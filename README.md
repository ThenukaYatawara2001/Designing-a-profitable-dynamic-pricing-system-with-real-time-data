# Designing-a-profitable-dynamic-pricing-system-with-real-time-data
This report presents a data-driven methodology for developing a dynamic pricing model tailored for the ride-
sharing industry. Leveraging historical ride data, we apply advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast
optimal fares in response to real-time market dynamics. The analysis is grounded on a rich dataset obtained from
Kaggle, encompassing various pricing-related features. Our findings offer valuable insights into fare optimization
strategies, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and pricing transparency. This research holds practical
significance for ride-sharing platforms, benefiting stakeholders including customers, drivers, business strategists,
and academic researchers
